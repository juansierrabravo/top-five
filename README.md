## Introduction
Welcome to this innovative Django project, crafted specifically to sharpen and showcase a myriad of software development skills to potential employers and collaborators. This project serves as a dynamic playground for mastering Test-Driven Development (TDD) and will evolve to encapsulate a broader spectrum of advanced programming concepts. At its core, the application boasts a sophisticated user management system paired with interactive functionalities that allow users to create, modify, and engage with top lists. From registering and logging in to voting on content with likes and dislikes, the platform is designed to highlight popular user-generated content right on the homepage. As the project progresses, expect to see the integration of SOLID principles, Docker, and various design patterns, enhancing both functionality and user interaction. This ongoing enhancement aims to not only demonstrate technical proficiency but also a commitment to continuous learning and improvement in software development.

## Features
### Core Offerings:
- **User Authentication:** Seamless registration, login, and logout experiences.
- **Dynamic Home Page:** Displays popular tops by day, week, and month, with filter options for name and tag.
- **User-Generated Content:** Your stage to create, modify, and showcase top lists that capture your unique perspective.

## Installation
### Clone the Repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/juansierrabravo/top-five.git
$ cd top-five
```

### Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project
### Set environment variables
```bash
$ cp .env.example .env # Then, open the .env file and change the placeholder <CHANGE-ME> for the real values
```
**Note:** to generate a secret key, use the following Python script:
```python
from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
print(get_random_secret_key())
```

### Apply Migrations
Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) following the instructions for the specific operating system.

```bash
$ python manage.py migrate
```

### Create a Superuser
```bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Run the Development Server
```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

Access the project at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Testing
Install [Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver) to allow Selenium to inteact with the Firefox web browser (this is for the functional tests).

```bash
$ python manage.py test
